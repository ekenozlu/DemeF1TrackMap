# DemoF1TrackMap
In this demo app I created a map application to show current F1 Circuits on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Full map of current F1 Circuits
2. Table of circuits for quick travel
3. UIAlert to show history of track

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. MapKit
2. Annotations, Markers, Coordinates, Regions

## Currently working on:
1. Custom Pins with correct positioning on zoom out.
2. Better Info Screen with images and few more details
3. Displaying old circuits with another color and filter them through their details like length and year etc.
4. Better Map Style
